"""This module contains the Arc-Eager transition parser algorithm (Nivre 2003).
Builds a tree eagerly by adding arcs as soon as possible and 
attaches all left dependents first before right dependents.

The ROOT is placed at the end of the buffer in this variation of Arc-Eager
(Ballesteros and Nivre 2013).
This leads to better performance and guarantees a well-formed tree without
postprocessing.

Can only run projective parsing.
